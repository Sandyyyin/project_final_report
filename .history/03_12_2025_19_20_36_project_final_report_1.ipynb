    "The data we are provided in this project are the _players.csv_ and _sessions.csv_ datasets which originate from a Minecraft server run by a research group known as \"The Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI)\" in Computer Science at UBC. These researchers' goal of this Minecraft server is to ultimately use player input data to train AI. However, such a process is not only expensive, but also resource demanding! As such, they seek to recruit specific players who are more likely to contribute valuable/meaningful data on this Minecraft server. Thus, with this goal in mind, we will only be analyzing the _players.csv_ in this report due to the fact that the predictive question we aim to answer doesn't require the _sessions.csv_ dataset. This _players.csv_ dataset simply contains unique data in relation to each individual who has participated in the server. Details will be further explained in section 1.3 below. In addition to this, the specificity of the question we wish to answer will also be expanded upon in the subsequent section. It is important to note that the _players.csv_ data presented was gathered via self-reporting during server signup and compiled into a csv by the researchers. Therefore, the data collected may contain untruthful information that does not reflect a player's true results since signups were self-reported! Once again, the goal of this project report is to help the researchers determine players who will actually provide meaningful data. This will be hopefully achieved via the  tidying the _players.csv_ dataset, altering the data to better fit our specific question, visualizations by plotting, data analysis using techniques like K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification, and finally visualizing these analysis techniques in an attempt to ultimately answer our formulated question! These processes will all be simulated in Jupyter Notebook using the coding language R-Script! "
